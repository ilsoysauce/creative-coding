        Artist statement:

        This was a tough one for me! I couldn't figure out what I wanted the landscape to look like. Totally blank on ideas. So in the end I ended up sticking with the mountain idea and worked my way around it. The original vision was to add stars, rivers, and something on the mountains (Trees/buildings/or just patches of grass) at different times of day. I was able to get the stars and the gradient backgrounds in, but I struggled most with working the things on the mountains on. They tend to overlap or fall off the side, and I didn't exactly feel like fixing it. In the end, I managed to get several variations of it. Something differs almost everytime.
